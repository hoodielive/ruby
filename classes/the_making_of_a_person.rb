class Person
    attr_accessor :name, :age, :gender
end

# a class is a concept, a blueprint, a definition of an object - should always start with a capital letter
# proceeding line creates 'attributes' (attr) and accessor means 'make these attr accessible to be set or changed at will'
# thus, Person object and we can change the name, age and gender or more accurately name,age,gender attributes
